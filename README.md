# Cyclone

Cyclone is a simple game engine designed for learning about computer graphics and game physics engine development. It leverages OpenGL for rendering, providing a practical environment for experimentation and education.

## Features
- OpenGL-based rendering
- Basic physics simulation
- Modular design for easy extension

## Setup
// TODO

## Usage
// TODO 

## Credits
This project is based on the physics engine implementation detailed in "Game Physics Engine Development" by Ian Millington and the graphics techniques from [ogldev.org](https://www.ogldev.org/index.html).
